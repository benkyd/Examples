### Code Samples

This is basically a repo of some of my random small scale projects which i may some day come back and reference. Feel free to contribute and add to it yourself.

This repository contains multiple instances of a personally modified olcPixelGameEngine for use in multiple projects (www.onelonecoder.com), the main branch can be found at https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine.
